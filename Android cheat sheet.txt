OOPS 
Object
Class
Inheritance
Polymorphism
	Which is run time which is compile time 
	Overloading  >> Compile time
	Overriding >> Run time >> Because which parent method to be overrrigden can check runtime
	Can we set diffrent return type in overloading ? No
Encapsulation
Abstraction
Encapsulation Hiding unwanted data and giving relevent data >> Encapsulation hiding/protecting data
One concept is about hiding giving something other is about hiding something
Abstraction focus on outer layer Encapsulation is on inner layer
Implemented using abstract class and interface
Encapsulation >>> Access modifires


Interface Single Multilevel Multiple Hyrachical
Diffrence between abstraction and interface
Interface question 
Can we declare variable in interface
Can we declare static method in interface
Can static and final method can be overridden
Can we implement interface with another interface
Why multiple inheritance is not supported by java - Dimond problem
